## Thick Mapping

1. What are your thoughts on "thick mapping in the digital humanities," and how does it differ from "mapping?"

"Thick mapping in the digital humanities", unlike the colder, calculative approach of "mapping", envisions layers of history and interpretation under every grid on the map of the world, and to see much more than a reference to a physical location can keep people more in touch with their humanity. 

2. How does the theory of "thick mapping" inform narratives that are influencing your life?

The theory of thick mapping was a reminder why I enjoy my digital humanities courses so much. I thought of imperialism and colonisation, and how much of everything that I am has been influenced by these events. Colonizers must have used maps in order to "discover" the locations that they took control of, and they must have seen the people that they colonized as unhuman and unfamiliar. I hope that an emergence of thick mapping may allow people to better connect with each others through the stories that thick mapping tells. I can see thick mapping having the potential to help prevent the kind of senseless takeover that humans have done so much of already, whether that is on Earth or on other galaxies.
