<h1>About Lynn Tieu</h1>
<p>Hello World! My name is Lynn Tieu. I am currently a senior at UCLA, set to graduate with an <b>Economics</b> major and a <b>Digital Humanities</b> minor in June 2021. I'm hoping to use my degree to eventually pursue a career that focuses on user experience design, but for now, I will be going into a full-time position as a data analyst post-grad. This quarter, I hope to improve on basic languages like HTML and CSS, and develop my skills in data analysis and visualization through mapping. In addition, I look forward to learning how to apply these skills for good in real life.</p>
